## Donut: UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Donut is a dictonary and grammar toolkit that allows for easy creation of an online dictionary, with inflected word forms. (More info to come...)

Donut is UNDER DEVELOPMENT, so it's structure might change drastically. If you are eager to try out some of the features already, installation goes as follows.

### Installation

* Clone the git repository to a web server that supports PHP 7 and MySQL (PHP 5.3+ might work, but is tested at time of writing)
* Edit config.php to your configuaration
* Import `db.sql` to the database
* Enjoy!

Please note that donut still misses a lot of features. At this moment you should only install donut if you want to take a look at its progress.
