# Donut Dictionary Toolkit
#### under construction

Donut is a dictionary and grammar toolkit that makes it easy to create and mantain an online dictionary and grammar for any language. It has purposes within descriptive linguistics and language construction.

Please note that Donut is under heavy development, so its structure might change drastically. If you are eager to try out some of the features already, installation goes as follows.

Donut is licensed under MIT.

### Requirements

* PHP 5.3+ (ideally PHP 7+)
* MySQL or MariaDB-server

### Installation

* Clone the git repository to a web server (alternativly just download its contents)
* Edit config.php to fit your configuaration (database usernames etc.)
* Import `db.sql` to the database
* It should work now.

**Note**: for now `db.sql` is filled with Dutch example content.

Please note that donut still lacks a lot of features. At this moment you should only install donut if you want to take a look at its progress.
